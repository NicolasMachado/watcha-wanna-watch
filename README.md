Watcha Wanna Watch is an online app that recommends movies according to your personality and tastes. Those are deducted by a group of NASA scientists after a series of short random questions.

##Introduction

There are thousands of movies out there, and still, there you are, wondering what to watch next. You also tend to watch the same kind of movies over and over. Watcha wanna watch takes you out of this mindset by selecting a set of movies for you. They are indirectly selected and calculated depending on the answers your provide to a short series of random questions.
